Excercises Dockerfile and docker-compose

Orchestration of 5 containers working together in frontend and backend networks for a simple poll app.

We are provided with 3 apps - vote(python), worker (C#) and result (node.js)
We should write the dockerfiles and run the apps along with redis and postgres db with docker-compose.
